NLP was originally distinct from text information retrieval (IR), which employs highly scalable statistics-based techniques to index and search large volumes of text efficiently: Manning et al1 provide an excellent introduction to IR.","The field of study that focuses on the interactions between human language and computers is called Natural Language Processing or NLP for short.
